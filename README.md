## Usage
You can run the following the command.

```
pip install requirements.txt
```

```
pip install SpatialEx
```
We have packaged our implementation into an easy-to-use Python library for use by the research community. The accompanying [tutorial](https://spatialex-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation.html) offers detailed guidance on how to use the package effectively.

A detailed guide to all applications in the paper is available in ```demonstration.ipynb```.
