## Usage
You can run the following the command.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```
pip install SpatialEx
```
Several important packages are listed below in case you prefer not to install too many packages.
```
anndata==0.8.0
scanpy==1.9.3
numpy==1.23.5
pandas==2.0.3
cellpose==3.0.10
scikit-image==0.21.0
scikit-learn==1.3.2
scikit-misc==0.2.0
torch==2.3.1
huggingface-hub==0.24.6
timm==1.0.8
torchvision==0.18.1
```

We recommend installing the above Python packages one by one to avoid potential errors.

We have packaged our implementation into an easy-to-use Python library for use by the research community. The accompanying [tutorial](https://spatialex-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation.html) offers detailed guidance on how to use the package effectively.

A detailed guide to all applications in the paper is available in ```Demonstration.ipynb```.
